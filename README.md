# React and Tailwind CSS Practice with Django REST Framework (DRF)

## Overview

This project is a continuation of [React-Tailwind](https://github.com/obdif/React-Tailwind) and serves as a practice to connect frontend and backend technologies. The frontend is built using React (with Vite), and the backend is powered by Python (Django and Django REST Framework).

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive, ensuring optimal performance across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Tailwind CSS Styling:** Tailwind CSS is used for streamlined and consistent styling across the entire project.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Built with React's component-based structure, enabling modularity and reusability of components.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Focused on delivering a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.
- **Authentication:** Sign-up and sign-in functionality using Django for backend authentication.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** A fast development build tool that bundles and serves the React application.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for designing custom layouts and styles efficiently.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Used for frontend interactivity and logic.
- **HTML5:** Structuring the web content.
- **CSS3:** Tailwind CSS is used to handle all styling.
- **Python (Django):** A powerful web framework that handles backend logic and API integration.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF):** A toolkit for building Web APIs with Django.

# React + Vite 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
